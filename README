iedit - Edit multiple regions simultaneously
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is an Emacs minor mode and allows you to edit one occurrence of some text in
a buffer (possibly narrowed), and simultaneously have other occurrences edited
in the same way.

Most common scenario of using this package is renaming refactoring
during programming.  Several enhancements are done to make it easier:
 - The symbol under point can be selected as occurrence by one key and only complete
   symbols are matched
 - Restrict symbols in current defun only by one command
 - Remember the renaming refactoring and re-apply to other buffers later

This package also provides rectangle support with visible rectangle
highlighting, i.e. you can interactively modify a rectangle.

You can also use Iedit mode as a quick way to temporarily show only the buffer
lines that match the current text being edited.  This gives you the effect of a
temporary 'keep-lines' or 'occur'.  To get this effect, hit `C-' when in
Iedit mode - it toggles hiding non-matching lines.

There are also some other facilities you may never think about.  Read the
document of function `iedit-mode' (C-h f iedit-mode RET) for more details.
